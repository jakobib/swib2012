# Library data in the Semantic Web

## From the abstract

Current efforts to publish library data as Linked Open Data (LOD) have focused
on bibliographic data, authority files and organizations. It took some time to
also publish information about single items and their current availability in
particular libraries. Applications that make use of these data sets are just
being created. 


# Patron information

## From the abstract

Patron information, consisting of links between library patrons and documents
held by libraries, however, is not published yet. This gap exists with good
cause because of privacy concerns but also because it is difficult to get
patron information out of legacy systems and because there is no encoding in
RDF yet.

# Patron data in the Semantic Web

## From the abstract

The proposed research report will present an encoding of patron
information in RDF that was created for two applications in the GBV library
network. The encoding aligns with existing ontologies, namely the Document
Availability Information Ontology (DAIA) and Semantically-Interlinked Online
Communities (SIOC). It will be shown how patron information from library
systems is extracted from (legacy) library systems and how the information is
encoded in RDF, among other formats. The patron information can then be
combined with other sources, while respecting patron privacy.
